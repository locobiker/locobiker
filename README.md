# 🚀 Mike Bautista | Creative Technologist & AI Explorer

### "Coding at the speed of creativity."

My passion is centered on helping.  I love empowering others by solving complex problems. Whether I’m designing cross-functional interfaces that simplify workflows, mentoring individuals through challenging seasons, or leading production teams to capture the energy of a live event, I am driven by the desire to create value and beauty for the world around me.

## 🛠 My Approach to AI & Code
These projects serve as a playground for my exploration into AI-augmented engineering. My goal was to push the boundaries of current LLMs to identify the precise inflection point where machine efficiency meets the necessity of human discernment and creativity. I treat tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot as high-performance power tools: they provide immense horsepower, but the highest-quality outcomes require:

* **A Firm Grip:** Maintaining technical oversight and code quality.
* **A Clear Goal:** Providing the creativity and direction to not just generate code, but to create a product that will have value.
* **Healthy Skepticism:** Testing and refining AI outputs to ensure robust architecture.

## 🎥 Live Production & Engineering
When I’m not coding, I’m in the director’s chair for live church productions. Managing volunteers in multi-cam environments has taught me how to stay calm under pressure and lead teams to a common goal. My code is often the solution to the friction points I find in the production world.
